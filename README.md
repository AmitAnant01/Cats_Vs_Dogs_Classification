# Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classifier
Created a deep learning project that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model was built with TensorFlow and Keras. I trained it on a large dataset of cats and dogs images, performed data preprocessing, and visualized the accuracy and loss during training. This project helped me understand how CNNs work for image recognition and how to train models to make accurate predictions.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a CNN model can accurately classify images of **cats** and **dogs**.  
The dataset is preprocessed, trained, and tested to achieve high accuracy using image augmentation and efficient model design.


## Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** [Kaggle - Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cats-and-dogs)
- Contains: `25,000` labeled images of cats and dogs.
- Split: `80% training`, `20% validation`


## Model Architecture
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Activation: ReLU
- Pooling: MaxPooling2D
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy

## Tools and Libraris that i use:
- Python 

- TensorFlow / Keras

- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
